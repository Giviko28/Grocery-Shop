# Idea and how it works
I don't really have a name for this app YET, but the idea is somewhat innovative.
"App Name" allows users to create their grocery list and compare pricess across various stores.  Imagine you have 50 items in your cart, the total might be 250$ in walmart, but 200$ in target. My application's main focus is to help you save money (Why bother overpaying?)
Even though my website is "Grocery" oriented, it could easily have a separate electronics, furniture section.

## What's next?

I'm currently "testing" my product. Do people like my idea? Do they like the design? Is it legally possible to set this up? and much more.
Therefore, i won't be working on the backend until i get the answer/
